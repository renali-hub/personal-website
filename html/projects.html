                  A human-centered digital solution that bridges the gap between 
                  potential pet owners and adoption organizations through 
                  increased education, guidance, and communication. We conducted 
                  rapid research to generate customer journey maps, which guided 
                  us in developing storyboards and paper prototypes. Then with an
                  iterative process of think-aloud testing, critiques, and 
                  prototyping our group developed our mock mobile app and website.

                  Lots Out There is a service that supports the city of Pittsburgh
                  in organizing and utilizing empty lots and increasing public 
                  trust by openning up engagement with the public. For citizens, 
                  our service streamlines the application process to obtain an 
                  empty lot, reducing as much friction as possible that's 
                  discouraging the public from improving upon vacant lots in their
                  community. Our team conducted in-depth domain and stakeholder 
                  research that allowed us to construct a stakeholder map. We than
                  drafted a design brief that guided us through developing our 
                  first prototype iterations. We also explored the inclusion of 
                  micro-interactions (such as swiping for more information) in 
                  our final prototype.

                With the rise of conversational assistants, our team explored 
                the conversational UI prototyping tool “Voiceflow”. We developed
                Kiwi, the travel companion, who would aid the user in generating
                an itinerary, planning a travel route, and create an experience 
                to be as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. To develop Kiwi,
                we utilized means and goals modelling, explored voice and tone, 
                and learned about the dangers of conversational UIs.

                  The very webpage you're looking at! This is my first attempt at 
                  building a portfolio website. I used this project as an 
                  opportunity to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with many 
                  YouTube tutorials) and to also showcase some of my design 
                  skills.
